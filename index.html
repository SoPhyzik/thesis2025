                <h3>Guide to navigating the project</h3>
                <p>This project is designed to be clicked through freely. There is no chronology or specific narrative to follow. There is no right or wrong way of approaching this project.</p>
                <p>However, this website is built like a tree, so if you want to methodically proceed through the website, you can click on a tab in the navigation bar, read the content of the page, and click through any links within that page. Then you can go on to the next tab in the navigation bar. </p>
                <p>This site also contains external links, as well as links to fictional sites that are disguised as external links. External sites that I have created will be listed here for reference:</p>
