            <p>I've never had a job.</p>
            <p>That was pretty unusual.</p>
            <p>But basically, when I graduated, I couldn't find anything. And I guess it used to be that you could go to like, a restaurant or something, and get at least a wage. But it became a thing, in the last few years, that restaurants didn't really exist in the same way.</p>
            <p>I think it's hard when you're living through something, to be able to identify that thing as a transformation, especially at a social level.</p>
            <p>I was living through the moment in time when people started disappearing, and at the time, it didn't feel that way. It felt like a weird week, or a weird summer, or a weird year. I felt that surely I'd be able to make plans with someone soon, or run into someone.</p>
            <p>I felt that, surely, someone would reopen one of the restaurants that had been boarded up, and I would be able to get a job somewhere.</p>
            <p>Anyway, this is a beautiful etching of a peasant woman gathering sticks.</p>
