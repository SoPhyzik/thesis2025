            To start you’ll need a myGov account. If you don’t have one, you can go to the myGov website to create one.

To link Centrelink to your myGov account, your name recorded with myGov must match your name with Centrelink. If we can’t link your record to myGov with the details you provide, you’ll need to call us for help.

We’ll ask you some questions to make sure we match the correct Centrelink record to your myGov account.

You’ll need to have all of the following:

your Customer Reference Number,
answers to some questions specific to you, such as your Centrelink payment history and bank account details.
You’ll also need one of the following:

access to the mobile phone number or email address registered with Medicare to receive a one-time passcode,
one identity document, such as your current Australian driver licence, Australian birth certificate or visa details.
Make sure you have this information ready before you begin.

If you don’t have or know your CRN and want to claim a Centrelink payment or service, read our other online guides:

Link Centrelink to myGov using Centrelink identity verification.
Link Centrelink to myGov using your Digital ID.

If you’ve already linked Medicare to your myGov account, we’ll show your myGov profile details. To link Centrelink, these details must match the details on your Centrelink record.

Select Continue to proceed.

We’ll ask you if you know your Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) and if you have a linking code.

Select Yes to Do you have or know your Customer Reference Number (CRN)?
Select No to Do you have a linking code? then select Next to continue.
