                <p>I have a memory </p>
                <!--I have a photograph, I should say-->
                <p>of this girl</p>
                <!--of that girl-->
                <p>I spoke to her last 4.5 years ago, and that was the last time I spoke to a person</p>
                <p>and the last time we spoke, it was over text message, and we said that we weren't going to see each other again</p>
                <!--we said goodbye, and that we would be respecting each others choices. I left her clothes and tupperware by her apartment door. 
                I came back a year later, when I began to think everyone had disappeared, and I knocked and knocked and eventually I looked it 
                up and found out that the apartment was open for rent. So she had moved.-->
                <!--Without saying anything, even though I know that I wouldn't have told her.-->
                <p>but the time before that, we called over a game - I think we were playing some online shooter with a server of bots</p>
                <p>we didn't have much to talk about. Our mutual friends had sort of disappeared. We hadn't had much in common in a long time. We talked -</p>
                <p>it's so funny, we talked about how bad the doordash food had gotten, because the drones at the time got a bad software update that meant that they kept getting lost.</p>
                <!--at one point, we switched over to a custom map. Which is - I guess is like, what players used to make themselves in the game engine and upload.
                But we switched to a custom map, because you can do "surfing". Surfing is this movement mechanic glitch in a lot of old shooters where 
                with the right custom map you can kind of turn this shooter into a skating or racing game. So we spent an hour or so surfing in this custom map.-->
                <p>We eventually said goodbye. We said we'd talk soon.</p>
                <!-- It was awkward though. You could tell that we needed to have a big conversation.-->
                <!--Before we hung up, we kept getting stuck on this particular bit of the map. It was a lot of quick jumping, and I've always had really slow reflexes. 
                She said, don't worry Art.
                Let's play something else. But I get really fixated - you can probably tell, hahah - on certain things. I wanted to get this part of the map.
                Maybe to prove somethig to her, I don' know. But I wanted to get it.-->
