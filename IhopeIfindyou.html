        <p>Do me a favour and hit whatever button on your computer allows you to view the source code on a webpage. For most people in my time, that's either Ctrl + U (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + U (Mac)</p>

    <!-- Hi future person. Funny running into you here.-->

    <!-- This is a HTML comment. HTML comments are written by developers to themselves or other developers. -->

    <!-- I definitely am not the first person to use hidden HTML comments to write. I can't remember where I saw it before exactly. 
     I just know that I love seeing flashes of a person's personality in the HTML comments. Especially entry-level stuff,
     developers often signpost what everything does. I did it above, for you to understand where the CSS would usually go!-->
     <!--I used to do a lot of hands-on crafting stuff. Embroidery was a big one for me.
     With embroidery, there is always a front and a back. You hide the construction of the piece on the wrong side, which no one
     will see but you. The viewer just sees the front, and the illusion suggests that the piece has come together like magic. 
     I think all art is like this, you're only supposed to see one side, not the effort it took to get there.
     But for me, and I think for a lot of artists through time, I love seeing the construction.
    If you're also an embroiderer, you might only care about the front a little bit. You're actually probably much more excited to
     see how this other person did it. That's how I feel about code.-->

    <!-- To be honest, I don't have a development background, which is maybe why I still see that magic. Everything I've learnt, 
     I taught myself. There are a lot of good videos published before 2030ish on web development, but past that point it's a lot 
     of AI slop. In case you don't know or can't look it up, AI slop is high-volume, low-quality products of generative AI. 
     There's no human input, which means that a lot of the content is inaccurate, or low-quality. A lot of institutions like universities
     started feeding their course content into large language models around that time period, in order to streamline their
     productivity, and published cheap courses that could be taken online. That content was itself taken and
     repurposed by people unaffiliated with universities, and fed into other AI programs, and created different courses to be seperately sold.-->
    
     <!-- I got pretty fixated on 2020-2030s AI history for a while and I don't like having to self-moderate, especially on my own site. 
    There's no point, because there's no one left to annoy by talking to much about something. I think there's just too much to tell.
    so I have to be careful with my energy. I have to explain the whole world to you.-->
