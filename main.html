                    <h1>My name is Art. If you found this website this, it means I failed.</h1>
                    <p>I guess actually that might not be true. I might be sitting next to you, and showing you the page myself. Or maybe we're on a call because you're physically far away and I sent you the link directly. But more likely, I'm dead, and you found this online somehow. The idea of that makes me so sad. I wish I'd found you, whoever you are.</p>
                    <p>But what is this site, you probably want to know. I created this space to collect all of my thoughts and feelings, as well as archive all of the stuff that I make.</p>
                    <p>I love puzzles, and experimenting, so hopefully you find some interesting stuff here. Maybe you like puzzles and experimenting too.</p>
                    <p>I also wanted to make this site as a way of documenting my search. I don't know how much to explain because I don't know how much you know already.</p>
                    <p>I'll link this page. You should have a read:</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Sorry if you know all of that. But maybe you're like, a test tube baby raised by a robot somewhere, finally with access to the internet. Or like, a sentient AI. Or even an alien, whose civilisation has finally developed the technology to untangle the data threads that leaked out into dark space a million billion years ago. Would that make me feel better or worse, knowing that there was no hope at all? That I was searching for nothing?</p>
                    <p>I was lying in bed just now, and I opened up this page because I was really close to giving up. On everything - on my search. On life. So I opened this up to be like, hey, I need to give a blurb for whatever I'm doing here. Just in case.</p>
                    <p>That's all this is - a just in case. Just in case I don't find you. But I hope I find you.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, I learned about the Golden Record.</p>
                    <img src="images\The_Sounds_of_Earth.jpg" alt="A golden record, labelled 'The Sounds of Earth'." width="500">
                    <img src="images\The_Sounds_of_Earth_Record_Cover.jpg" alt="A gold aluminum disc designed to cover the record, engraved with symbols to demonstrate how to use the record." width="500">
                    <p>I wouldn't say I got obsessed - I know when I'm obsessed with something, I usually make a <a href="shrines.html">shrine</a> about it. But I definitely was interested. And that got me thinking about other ways of communication, how I could tell someone about who I was without actually being there.</p>
                    <p>But basically the Golden Record is - and again, sorry if you already know this - but it's like, evidence of sentience, designed to be recognised by other sentience. The idea is that a sufficiently intelligent species would be able to decipher the data on the golden record, because of stuff like universal mathematical rules.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I want to show you how to navigate this website, and understand my sentience and my search.</p>
