                <p>I deleted all my journal stuff from before April. I do that sometimes. For me, part of being obsessed with archives is being obsessed with destroying archives. You'd think things stay on the internet forever, or people used to say that a lot, but they don't. It's so easy to lose things. It's the same as dropping a rock into the ocean. It's like, yeah, it's probably still there, but you're never EVER gonna find it again.</p>

                <p>Drove to the bay tonight. Wanted to check if any new ships had washed up. See pics here:</p>

                <p>Been getting really into open access archives lately. I remember seeing a video about it ages ago but I can't find it anymore. But basically <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?searchField=All&showOnly=openAccess&sortBy=relevance">the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> maintains an online databank of their archive. Or their bots do. There's detailed descriptions of literally every piece, high res pics from every important angle, even a paragraph about the piece. I have no idea how they paid people to do it, it seems like so much labour and I can't remember the last time I felt like there was any money for stuff like museums. </p>
                <p>Anyway, this is my fav piece in the archive</p>
