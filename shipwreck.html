                <p>Here is the ocean, recorded across countries.</p>
                <p>Before now, I'd never thought about what the ocean might sound like in different places. But it is different, isn't it?</p>

                <p>Now if you look at this ASCII here, and you play one of the sounds, you can sort of know what it was like today for me. Maybe you might imagine me in Suffolk, or Maui, or Pattaya.</p>
                <p>It'd be a lie. I've never been to any of these places. The people who recorded these are gone.</p>
