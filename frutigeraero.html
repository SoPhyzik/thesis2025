                <h1>✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*Frutiger Aero✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:*</h1>
                
                <p>I'm trying to think of things to tell you about. But all I've cared about for years is really old internet history.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Frutiger Aero! Think CGI, airbrushing and photobashing. Seawater has never looked so drinkable.</p>
                <p>When you look at this background image, I wonder if there's any part of your world that looks like that.</p>
                <p>Here's a story:</p>
                <p><b>Long ago, there was a young fisherman called Urashima Tarō. One day he saw a group of children on the shore, toying with a little turtle. </b></p>
                <p><b>Urashima Tarō’s heart was kind, and he took the turtle from the children and released it back into the sea.</b></p>
                <p><b>The next day, while Tarō was fishing on his boat as always, a huge shape rose up from the ocean. It was a huge turtle, and it told Tarō that the turtle he saved was the daughter of the Sea Emperor, and the emperor now wants to thank him. The turtle gave him gills and took him down through the water to Ryūgū-jō, the Palace of the Dragon God. </b></p>
                <p><b>The princess thanked him for saving her from the children. <i>When we are small, we are vulnerable, and we cannot protect ourselves. I am bigger now. Thank you. </i></b></p>
                <p><b>They spent a few days in Ryūgū-jō, but Urashima Tarō grew homesick, and was keen to leave the palace for his village. The princess tried to convince him to stay, but he thought about his parents, who were old and needed him. </b></p>
                <p><b>The princess acquiesced and gave him a tamatebako, or jewelled hand-box. <i>Do not open this box,</i> she said. Why she gave him the box, I never understood. Was she angry? Did she want to punish him?</b></p>
                <p><b>When Urashima Tarō resurfaced, his home was entirely different. His parents were gone. He went to the villagers and asked if they had ever heard of someone called Urashima Tarō. They said that someone of that name vanished at sea over a hundred years ago. His parents, his home, were all long gone. </b></p>
                <p><b>Struck by grief, he forgot the princess’s warning and opened the box. <i>“A cloud of white smoke bursts forth”, </i>each version of this story says. This detail is maintained across many different versions. Urashima Tarō is always consumed by white smoke.</b></p>
                <p><b>When the smoke cleared, Urashima Tarō had aged 100 years. His body was shrivelled and small. His beard was long and white. From the sea, came the voice of the princess.</b></p>
                <p><b><i>I told you not to open that box. In it was your old age…</i></b></p>
                <p>Here's another:</p>
                <p><b>When I was little, I used to go visit my grandparents with my dad. My grandparents' place was in the outer suburbs, and we would drive for a long time to reach them. When I was there, I didn’t have anything to play with, so I would go on the computer and play the random games that were installed on their desktop. Stuff like minesweeper and solitaire.</b></p>
                <p><b>You might not know what solitaire is. It’s like an old person’s game that you play with a deck of cards.</b></p>
                <p><b>Minesweeper is like, a guessing game.</b></p>
                <p><b>But I really liked this one where you controlled a little village of people, and you could send them to build stuff and collect firewood and things like that. </b></p>
                <p><b>I’d play that game while my grandparents and dad chatted. Sometimes, someone would come in and give me something to eat. Or I’d be called out, and I’d have to go hang out with my grandparents and dad. It was hard because they didn’t speak much English, and I didn’t speak Polish. But it was okay. When I was little it didn’t matter as much.</b></p>
                <p><b>I didn’t know how to save the game, so I’d never make progress. But every time, I was really excited to restart that village and build the same houses. I liked doing the same thing every time. </b></p>
                <p>Anyway. Click on the journal tab to keep going.</p>
