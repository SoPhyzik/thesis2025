                <p>I deleted all my journal stuff from before April. I do that sometimes. For me, part of being obsessed with archives is being obsessed with destroying archives. You'd think things stay on the internet forever, or people used to say that a lot, but they don't. It's so easy to lose things. It's the same as dropping a rock into the ocean. It's like, yeah, it's probably still there, but you're never EVER gonna find it again.</p>
